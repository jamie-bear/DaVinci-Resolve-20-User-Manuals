Clip Name: Editing the Clip Name lets you change the name with which clips appear throughout
DaVinci Resolve when View > Use Clip Name for Clip Titles is enabled. By default, the clip name mirrors
the source clip’s file name. When editing the clip name in the List view of the Media Pool, you can use
“metadata variables” that you can add as graphical tags that let you reference clip metadata.
For example, you could add the corresponding metadata variable tags %scene_%shot_%take and that
clip would display “12_A_3” as its name if “scene 12,” “shot A,” “take 3” were its metadata. The clip name
can also be edited in the Clip Attributes window.
For more information on the use of variables, as well as a list of all variables that are available in DaVinci
Resolve, see Chapter 16, “Using Variables and Keywords.”

Using Metadata View in the Media Pool
In the Metadata View mode, each clip is represented by its own card with a thumbnail and basic
clip metadata information visible. This view is designed to have more metadata information than a
thumbnail but more targeted information than the List view. This feature, combined with its sort modes,
is a powerful way to organize and reorganize your clips in the Media Pool.
```
The metadata fields of the Metadata view (from the top down):
```
 Thumbnail: A scrubbable thumbnail image of your clip.
 Row 1: A main description field that is variable and determined by the sort order selection.
